          <h3>About the Chart</h3>
          <p><strong>In a hypothetical three-way race between Bernie
          Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donal Trump, what percentage
          of Democrats, Republicans and independents would vote for
          each candidate?  What would be the outcome?</strong> </p>

          <p>I promised myself I wouldn't get into predication in
          this election.  It's a <a href="">Black Swan</a> election.
          But I was curious what a three-way race would look like, how
          the <strong>#bernieorbust</strong> movement might impact it,
          and how other developments were affecting it.</p>

          <p>I could not find any really great data.  Apparently, no one
          has done the polling, partly because Sanders has repeatedly
          said he would not run as an independent if he failed to win
          the Democratic primary.  If new data becomes available, it is
          easy for you to plug it in.</p>

          <p>However, there are some numbers you can plug in that produce
          interesting results.</p>

          <ol>

              <li>According to a <a
              href="http://www.wsj.com/video/poll-33-of-sanders-supporters-wouldnt-vote-for-clinton/69C05055-85FE-4320-8D02-3EAC972CACD0.html">Wall
              Street Journal/NBC News poll</a>, 33% of Sanders'
              supporters cannot see themselves voting for Hillary Clinton
              in November.</li>

              <li>An April 25<sup>th</sup> <a
              href="http://www.politicususa.com/2016/04/25/bombshell-poll-20-republicans-vote-hillary-clinton-trump-wins.html">Suffolk
              University poll</a> has found that 19% of Republicans say
              they will support the Democratic nominee if Donald Trump
              wins the Republican nomination.</li>

              <li>Currently, Sanders is polling at 44% in national
              primary polls.  </li>

              <li>Among independents, Sanders has
              a huge lead over Clinton, 45% to 29% in this <a
              href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2016ReuterTracking4132016.pdf">Ipsos/Reuters
              poll</a>.  </li>

          </ol>

          <p>There are some assumptions built into this chart that should be considered.

          <ul>
              <li>We assume that the percentagle of Democrats, Republicans
              and independents that decide to not vote at all is the
              same for all groups.  That is not likely true, and is highly dependent
              on multiple factors, but at this point there is not enought data available.
          </ul>

          <p>The percentage of Democrats, Republicans and
          independents in the electorate is taken from this <a
          href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180440/new-record-political-independents.aspx">
          Gallup Poll</a>.  The independents are rounded up 1% to make
          an even 100% and include third parties like the Green Party
          and Libertarian party.</p>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>You can adjust the slider handles to zero, to simulate a two-way race between any two of the candidates.</p>

          <p>You can simluate a two-way race between Clinton and Trump
          and set the Bernie number to correspond to the #bernieorbust
          and "stay home" numbers.
