          <h3>About the Chart</h3>
          <p><strong>In a hypothetical three-way race between Bernie
          Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donal Trump, what percentage
          of Democrats, Republicans and independents would vote for
          each candidate?  What would be the outcome?</strong> </p>

          <p>I promised myself I wouldn't get into prediction in
          this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">Black Swan</a> election.
          But I was curious what a three-way race would look like, how
          the <strong>#bernieorbust</strong> movement might impact it,
          and how other developments were affecting it.</p>

          <p>I could not find any really great data.  Apparently, no one
          has done the polling, partly because Sanders has repeatedly
          said he would not run as an independent if he failed to win
          the Democratic primary.  (If you find some, please send it my way.)
          However, there is a growing movement
          that <emphasis>wants</emphasis> Sanders to
          <a href="http://movement4bernie.org/">run as an independent</a>. 
          Others hope <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/04/29/the-push-to-make-sanders-the-green-partys-candidate/">Sanders will be the Green Party's candidate.</a>
          Even if you don't like those ideas, it might be good to think of
          Bernie as representing the constituency of liberal-minded
          people who resonate with his anti-establishment message.
          Where are they going to turn in the future for political
          representation?  </p>

          <p>
          I don't have a crystal ball, but this dynamic chart allows you to 
          put in your own best estimation of which way the political winds
          are blowing.  I hope better polling data will soon become available.
          </p>

          <p>However, there are some polls that suggest certain inclinations.</p>

          <ol>

              <li>According to a <a
              href="http://www.wsj.com/video/poll-33-of-sanders-supporters-wouldnt-vote-for-clinton/69C05055-85FE-4320-8D02-3EAC972CACD0.html">Wall
              Street Journal/NBC News poll</a>, 33% of Sanders'
              supporters cannot see themselves voting for Hillary Clinton
              in November.</li>

              <li>An April 25<sup>th</sup> <a
              href="http://www.politicususa.com/2016/04/25/bombshell-poll-20-republicans-vote-hillary-clinton-trump-wins.html">Suffolk
              University poll</a> has found that 19% of Republicans say
              they will support the Democratic nominee if Donald Trump
              wins the Republican nomination.</li>

              <li>Currently, Sanders is polling at 44% in national
              primary polls.  In national polls against Trump he wins 51% to 38%.
              (See <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/">
               RealClearPolitics</a> for the latest polls.)</li>

              <li>Among independents, Sanders has
              a huge lead over Clinton, 45% to 29% in this <a
              href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2016ReuterTracking4132016.pdf">Ipsos/Reuters
              poll</a>.  </li>

          </ol>

          <p>There are some assumptions built into this chart that should be considered.

          <ul>
              <li>We assume that the percentagle of Democrats, Republicans
              and independents that decide to not vote at all is the
              same for all groups.  That is not likely true, and is highly dependent
              on multiple factors, but at this point there is not enough data available.</li>

              <li>This is for the popular vote only, it doesn't take
              into account the allocation of electors by state.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>The percentage of Democrats, Republicans and
          independents in the electorate is taken from this <a
          href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180440/new-record-political-independents.aspx">
          Gallup Poll</a>.  The independents are rounded up 1% to make
          an even 100% and include third parties like the Green Party
          and Libertarian Party.</p>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <ol>
              <li>You can adjust the slider handles to zero, to simulate a
              two-way race between any two of the candidates.</li>

              <li>You can simulate a two-way race between Clinton and Trump
              and set the Bernie percentages to correspond to the #bernieorbust, write-in
              and "stay home" numbers.</li>
